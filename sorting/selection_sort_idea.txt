repeatedly selects the smallest or largest from unsorted portion 
move to the sorted portion of the array
time complexity O(N^2)

to sort - (n-1)-number if elements have to be re-arranged
execution must be of n-1 times in outer loop 

in each pass, find maximum index using inner loop 
compare minimum to maximum indexed element
after inner loop, ith element will swap

ALGORITHM : 
min_idx = 0 th index
search minimum 
swap with min_idx
increment min_idx to next element point 
repeat till sorted
