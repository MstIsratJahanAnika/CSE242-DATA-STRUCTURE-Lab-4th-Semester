swap elements if they are in wrong order 
time complexity O(N^2)
not suitable for large data 

sort an array 
one loop will pass n-1 times 
other will compare 2 elements
each pass array will sort one element 

ALGORITHM :
check if first one is greater than second one
if yes, swap 
if no, move pointer forward 
repeat until end
of array
